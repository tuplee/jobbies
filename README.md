I don't know about you, but I have zero patience to wade through any more job boards every day, looking for a job that was just posted so that I actually have a chance at landing it. 
And the notification emails that some of these job boards send? They are too late and often full of jobs that have nothing to do with my skillset, the keywords I wanted to search, or the job profile that I am pursuing. 

So this project will be a job scraping app, in Python, that allows a user to signup for an email service. 
This email service will deliver jobs, as they are posted, to the user's inbox that match either the keywords or the profile that the user selected during signup.
These jobs will be scraped using the ScrapFly API because I think it gives the best chance at success - open to other, better options though!
There should be an option for the user to change their search keywords/profile after signing up.

**Really IMPORTANT -->** DO NOT USE CHATGPT TO WRITE THE CODE. I guess it's called old school now to lurk stack exchange, but you need to work on your Python without chat doing so much heavy lifting. You can ask it questions but you may not copy/paste its code.

For testing, a CLI interface for the app will work well enough. Once it has been integrated, a proper UI/UX experience for the application will conclude the project development.

Here is what needs to be developed as I see it:

*    User Management Module:
      *  User Signup:
        Create a signup form to collect user email and preferences.
        Store user data securely in a database.

      *  User Authentication:
        Implement a login system to authenticate users.
        Use tokens or sessions for user authentication.

      *  Database Integration:
        Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store user data. Develop locally for testing first and then migrate to cloud resource.
        Set up database tables for users and their preferences.

*    Scraping Module:
      * Setup Scrapfly API: We'll set up Scrapfly API and configure it to scrape job board URLs asynchronously. We'll need to create an account on Scrapfly and obtain API credentials.

      * Asynchronous Scraping: Implement asynchronous scraping of job board URLs using Python's asyncio or other asynchronous libraries. This allows us to scrape multiple URLs concurrently, improving performance.

      * Handling Scraped Data: Process the scraped data to extract relevant job postings and information. We'll need to define the structure of the data we want to extract and store it appropriately.

      * Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during the scraping process. This ensures robustness and reliability of the scraping module.

      * Integration with User Management: Integrate the scraping module with the user management module to customize scraping based on user preferences, such as prebuilt filters or custom keywords.

*    Filtering Module:
      * Prebuilt Filters: Develop a set of prebuilt filters for common job roles such as "Software Engineer," "Data Analyst," etc. These filters will allow users to quickly select their desired job roles without entering custom keywords.

      * Custom Keywords: Implement functionality for users to enter custom keywords for filtering job postings. This allows users to specify specific criteria based on their preferences.

      * Filtering Logic: Write the logic to filter scraped job postings based on the selected prebuilt filters or custom keywords. This involves comparing the job postings against the user's preferences and determining if they match.

      * Integration with Scraping Module: Integrate the filtering module with the scraping module to filter job postings as they are scraped. This ensures that only relevant job postings are processed further.

      * User Preferences Management: Develop functionality for users to manage their filter preferences, including adding, editing, and deleting filters and keywords.

*    Notification Module:
      * Email Notification Setup: Set up email notification functionality to send alerts to users when a job posting matching their preferences is detected. We'll need to choose an email service provider and configure our application to send emails.

      * Real-time Alerting: Implement real-time alerting so that users receive email notifications immediately upon detecting a matching job posting. This ensures timely delivery of alerts to users.

      * Integration with Filtering Module: Integrate the notification module with the filtering module to trigger email notifications when a job posting matches the user's selected filters or keywords.

      * Email Content Customization: Allow users to customize the content of the email notifications, such as including job details or providing a summary of matching postings.

      * Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle issues such as failed email delivery or invalid email addresses. This ensures robustness and reliability of the notification module.
 
      * Use stubs/Mocking to test module

*    Integration Module:
      * Seamless Integration: Ensure that all modules (user management, scraping, filtering, and notification) integrate seamlessly to form a cohesive application.

      * Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle issues that may arise during integration, such as failed API calls, invalid data, or communication errors between modules.

      * Data Flow: Define the flow of data between modules, including how data is passed from one module to another and how responses or notifications are propagated back to the user.

      * Testing Integration: Perform integration testing to verify that the entire application functions correctly when all modules are working together. This ensures that the application meets the requirements and behaves as expected in a real-world scenario.

      * Documentation: Document the integration process and data flow to aid in understanding and troubleshooting the application in the future.
 
*    UI/UX Module

Use informative commit messages, develop and test modules separately before integrating, and don't forget, this project is where we are learning how to do unit testing and CI/CD pipelines. Document everything for a project breakdown.
